**Abstract:** Behavioral tasks and training and testing history affect measured outcomes in cognitive tests. Rats sample odors longer in a go/no-go (GNG) than in a two-alternative choice (TAC) task, performing better in GNG unless they know both tasks. Odor-sampling time is extended in both tasks when the odors to be discriminated are very similar. Rats may extend sampling time to integrate odor information up to ∼0.5 s (2–6 sniffs). Such factors as task, task parameters, and training history affect decision times and performance, making it important to use multiple tasks when making inferences about sensory or cognitive processing.

**Dr. Kay** received a BA in Liberal Arts from St. John's College in Santa Fe, New Mexico and then worked for the original GenBank project at Los Alamos National Laboratory from 1982-85. She worked as a programmer/analyst in business applications for a number of years in the mid- to late 80s, and then returned to graduate school at UC Berkeley. She completed her dissertation research in the laboratory of Walter J. Freeman, and received a Ph.D. in Biophysics in 1995. Kay completed postdoctoral research in the laboratory of Gilles Laurent at the California Institute of Technology, where she studied olfactory bulb mitral cell responses to changes in odor context.

The Kay laboratory uses behavioral neurophysiology to examine how context, perceptual history, learning and physiological state interact within the brain during sensory perception. The lab studies the physiology of sensory and perceptual processing and learning in the olfactory and limbic systems, using laboratory rats and mice, with several behavioral paradigms designed to uncover different behavioral and cognitive states. Recording and analytical techniques span several scales, from the single neuron, to small populations, large populations, and distributed systems of cortical and subcortical regions. Theoretical interpretations are aimed at understanding system level dynamics and pathology and at examining neural coding hypotheses using the framework of complex dynamical systems.
